# MySQL Beginner Practice Set (create, INSERT, SELECT, WHERE, Aggregates)
For students who have learned:
- create TABLE
- INSERT INTO
- SELECT (basic queries)
- WHERE clause
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN)

## Problem 1: School Database Setup
Task:
- create a database school.
- create a students table with:
    - student_id (INT, primary key)
    - name (VARCHAR)
    - class (VARCHAR, e.g., "10A")
    - marks (INT)
### Insert 5 records with Indian names (e.g., "Aarav", "Priya").


## Problem 2: Basic SELECT Queries
Tasks:
- Select all students from class "10A".
- Find students with marks â‰¥ 85.
- Count how many students are in "9B".
- Expected Output Examples:

## Problem 3: Aggregate Functions
Tasks:
- Find the average marks for each class.
- Get the highest and lowest marks in the school.
- Calculate the total marks of all students.


## Problem 4: Filtering with WHERE + Aggregates
Tasks:
- Find classes where the average marks are above 85.
- Count how many students scored below the school average.


## Problem 5: Real-World Scenario (Library)
Task: create a books table:
- book_id (INT)
- title (VARCHAR)
- author (VARCHAR)
- pages (INT)

### Insert 5 books (e.g., "The Guide" by R.K. Narayan).
Write queries to:
- Find books with more than 200 pages.
- Calculate the average pages per author.



## Problem 6: Bonus Challenges
Tasks:
- Update Priya's marks to 95 (UPDATE statement).
- Delete all books with less than 200 pages.


# Key Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce basic SQL syntax (create, INSERT, SELECT).
- Master WHERE filtering with numbers/text.
- Practice aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT) on real data.
